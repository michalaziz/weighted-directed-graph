# oop-Ex2

In this project we builded a directed weighted graph. We implemented algorithms and created the possibility of drawing every possible graph. The project was written in JAVA using intellij worksplace.
First, we wrote data structure containing the classes:Node, Edge and DGraph. after that we implemented the Graph_Algo class, where we used famous algorithms like DFS and Dijkstra to implement the shortestpathdist and isConnected algorithms.
At the end, we wrote a GUI class that allows drawing of every possible graph.
